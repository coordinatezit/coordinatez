  `next.config.ts`.

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local   # fill in SMTP + optional keys
npm run dev
```

Production build: `npm run build && npm start`.

## Configuration

All company facts (addresses, phones, emails, division copy, social links) live in
`src/data/site.ts`. Form recipients are controlled by `CONTACT_TO_EMAIL` /
`CAREERS_TO_EMAIL` env vars — see `.env.example` for everything configurable.

Content data lives in `src/data/` (services, trade capabilities, industries, insights,
jobs, FAQs, network coordinates). Job listings: add entries to `openPositions` in
`src/data/jobs.ts` — the Careers page and JobPosting schema pick them up automatically.

## Integrity rules

This site deliberately contains **no fabricated** clients, testimonials, awards,
statistics, team bios, or office locations. Market cities shown on the network visuals
are labeled as markets/trade hubs, not offices. Keep it that way when adding content.
